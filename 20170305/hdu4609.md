>Problem Description  
King OMeGa catched three men who had been streaking in the street. Looking as idiots though, the three men insisted that it was a kind of performance art, and begged the king to free them. Out of hatred to the real idiots, the king wanted to check if they were lying. The three men were sent to the king's forest, and each of them was asked to pick a branch one after another. If the three branches they bring back can form a triangle, their math ability would save them. Otherwise, they would be sent into jail.  
However, the three men were exactly idiots, and what they would do is only to pick the branches randomly. Certainly, they couldn't pick the same branch - but the one with the same length as another is available. Given the lengths of all branches in the forest, determine the probability that they would be saved.  
Input  
An integer T(T≤100) will exist in the first line of input, indicating the number of test cases.  
Each test case begins with the number of branches N(3≤N≤105).  
The following line contains N integers a_i (1≤a_i≤105), which denotes the length of each branch, respectively.  
Output  
Output the probability that their branches can form a triangle, in accuracy of 7 decimal places.

令$a_i$表示数$i$有多少个，对$a$求一遍卷积就可以得到任选两个数，和为$x$的方案数，这里注意要去一下重。考虑到任意三个不能构成三角形的数，都有且仅有一个数大于等于另外两个数的和，所以我们搞一个前缀和就好了。  
R数组的计算不能放到外面。。。。。  
代码写得丑。。。。  
格式化软件差点不给格式化。。。。
